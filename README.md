# Secret Messages

This project allows to encode or decode a message using four diferent ciphers:

`Affine Cipher`

`Atbash Cipher`

`Caesar Cipher`

`Keyword Cipher`

It also allows to add another level of encryption by adding a one time pad key, and the possibility of split the message into blocks of five characters.
